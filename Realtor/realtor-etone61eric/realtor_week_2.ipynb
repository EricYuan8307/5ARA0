    "This notebook provides you with instructions for the Realtor project and a runtime environment for experimenting with your code. Before you can run the code in this notebook you'll need to select a _kernel_ that specifies the python version and Virtual Environment for running this notebook. Top-right in VSCode you'll find a button that opens a \"Change kernel\" menu. From this menu, select the `realtor39` kernel.\n",

    "## Completing Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solutions to the assignments should be implemented in the python files (`*.py`) under the project directory. These files indicate per assignment which sections you need to complete. After completing an assignment, commit and push your changes to GitHub. Your project will then be automatically evaluated against the test suite. As you continue to complete assignments, more tests should pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some assignments present open questions. These questions need to be answered _in the python files_ as well, under the indicated sections. The notebooks only offer guidance and an environment for you to experiment. That is, the notebooks are not evaluated for grading, only your answers provided in the python files count towards your grade. Your code and answers should be correct, concise and readable. We also look for clean and concise comments and commit history. Your project is graded as-is on GitHub at the time of the deadline. Make sure to commit frequently, and push your commits to GitHub.\n",

    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pytest` library executes pre-defined tests that verify the functionality of your code. You can run `pytest` through VSCode. In VSCode, open the testing tab (left menu). In this tab, click `Configure Python Tests`, select `pytest` as your testing library, and select the `test` directory as the directory that houses your tests. You can now run the tests from this tab. You can alternatively run the tests from the file explorer, or via the command line with `python -m pytest`. When you run the tests you will see most of them fail (only three should pass, for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirement Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a software project starts with a conversation with the client. The client might be an external company, your boss, a family member, or anyone that requires your services. In this conversation it is important to discover their technical needs. These needs can then be captured in user stories that describe, from a user-perspective, the main modes of interaction with the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project directory, the `predict_housing_prices.feature` file already describes a feature through two scenarios, from the perspective of a realtor. This feature is not just any text file; it is an actual program that can be executed using `pytest`. The individual steps for each scenario are detailed in `test_predict_housing_prices.py`. In the testing tab, run the tests for `test_predict_housing_prices.py`. You should see two failing tests, indicating that the desired functionality is not implemented yet. At the end of this project, both scenarios should (hopefully) pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenarios imply pre-processed datasets, trained models, estimates and other concepts that we have not yet defined, and that's ok for now. At the start of each project it should be our priority to manage the expectations of the client. Therefore, we should also write our scenarios in the \"language\" of the client, which allows them to offer feedback on high-level funtionality early in the project. This enables us to clear up any misunderstandings and hopefully prevent double work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "With an agreement on high-level functionality (and usually a signed quotation), it becomes our priority to deliver something tangible. A mockup for the user-interface is therefore usually the first order of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user (realtor) will enter new data through an interface, and a housing price prediction should be returned. The skeleton code already defines a `query_input_data` function that accepts two arguments, a list of `features`, and a dictionary of `categories`. This function queries the user for an input value for each of the `features`, and returns a `DataFrame` with the entered values. We can define our own features and categories, and invoke this function. You can select the cells below and run them with `shift-enter`. Executing the second cell opens up a dialog window at the top, requesting user input."
